# SQLiteHelper: A Micro-ORM for SQLite Database
SQLiteHelper is a micro-ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) designed to simplify application development with SQLite databases. It is particularly suitable for small to medium scale applications, eliminating the need to write every single SQL query from scratch.

On the other hand, Entity Framework (EF) which is a full scale ORM provide complete sets of functions. More is not always the best, be sure to consider [Pro and Cons of EF](https://www.codearteng.com/2024/04/entity-framework-advantages-and.html) before jumping right into it.
While Entity Framework is a robust ORM with a full set of features, SQLiteHelper on the other hand is designed with simplicity and speed in mind. It provides a streamlined interaction with SQLite databases through simple functions.

An article [Micro ORM vs ORM](https://yaplex.com/micro-orm-vs-orm/) written by Alex Shapovalov explained in details difference between Micro ORM vs ORM and how to choose among them.

## Dependency
* NuGet: [System.Data.SQLite.Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Data.SQLite.Core)
* .NET Framework 4.8

## Key Features of SQLiteHelper
SQLiteHelper comes with a set of features aimed at making your interaction with SQLite databases as smooth as possible:

1. **Manage Connection String:** With SQLiteHelper, you only need to provide the file path to the database file. It takes care of the rest.
2. **Automatic Open and Close Connection:** SQLiteHelper handles the connection to the database with a helper class. This means you no longer need to keep track of the connection status or worry about forgetting to release the database after a write operation.
3. **Object Mapping to Database Class:** SQLiteHelper allows you to perform read and write operations from the database with a single method call. It maps objects to the database class, simplifying the process of data manipulation.
4. **Handle Queries from Different Database Sources:** SQLiteHelper is capable of handling queries from different database sources, providing you with the flexibility you need when working with multiple databases.
5. **Utility Function**: Utility method such as `ClearTable`, `GetPrimaryKeys`, `GetTableSchema`  and others are implemented with measures to prevent SQL injection which could be easily overlook for beginners.

In conclusion, SQLiteHelper is a powerful tool for developers working with SQLite databases. It simplifies the process of database interaction, allowing developers to focus more on the application logic and less on writing SQL queries. Whether youâ€™re developing a small application or a medium-sized project, SQLiteHelper can help streamline your development process.

## Anatomy of SQLiteHelper
* **SQLiteHelper** *(abstract)*: This is the primary helper class for the SQLite database. It encompasses all methods for reading from and writing to the database.
* **SQLiteDatabaseHandler** *(abstract)*: This is a subclass derived from SQLiteHelper. It inherits all features from the SQLiteHelper class and additionally has the ability to toggle between remote and local databases, as well as synchronize data from a remote source to a local cached copy.
* **SQLiteDataReaderEx** *(extension)*: Extension class for `SQLiteDataReader` which handle `null` check for get value method.
* **SQLAttribute**: Attribute base class for table mapping.

# Using SQLiteHelper
## Create SQLite Database class
Create project specific database class inherite from `SQLiteHelper` class.
```C#
public class MyDatabase : SQLiteHelper
{
    public MyDatabase(string databaseFilePath): base()
    {
        SetSQLPath(databaseFilePath);
    }
}
```

## Read from Database Table
To read data from Table Employee with following columns:
```
Employee (Table)
  |- ID, INTEGER, Primary Key
  |- Name, TEXT
  |- Department, TEXT
  |- Salary, INTEGER
```

Store into data class named Employee as follow:
```C#
public class Employee
{
    public int ID {get; set;}
    public string Name {get; set;}
    public string Department {get; set;}
    public int Salary {get; set;}
}
```

1. Read data with `ExecuteQuery` method:
```C#
public Employee[] ReadEmployeeData()
{
    List<Employee> results = new List<Employee>();
    //Execute Query handle database connection
    ExecuteQuery("SELECT * FROM Employee", (r) =>
    {
        //(r) = Delegate call back function with SQLiteDataReader parameter r.
        //Disposal of r is taken care by ExecuteQuery method.
        int x;
        while(r.Read())
        {
            x = 0;
            Employee e = new Employee();
            e.ID = r.GetInt32(x++);
            e.Name = r.GetStringEx(x++);  //Extension method. Handle null value.
            e.Department = r.GetStringEx(x++);
            e.Salary = r.GetInt32Ex(x++);
        }
    });
}
```

2. Implementation above can be further simplify using query with class - `ReadFromDatabase`
```C#
public Employee[] ReadEmployeeData()
{
    return ReadFromDatabase<Employee>().ToArray();
}
```

## Update Data to Database
To update data in a database, you can utilize the `WriteToDatabase` method. Alternatively, achieving the same results is possible by employing the `ExecuteNonQuery` method.
```C#
public void WriteEmployeeData(Employee[] newDatas)
{
    WriteToDatabase(newDatas);
}
```

# ORM
The `ReadFromDatabase` and `WriteToDatabase` methods implement object-to-database mapping. They are designed to work with child tables and support multiple database sources using an easy-to-understand syntax. To get started, let's walk through some basic rules and assumption.

These 2 methods are designed with [Fail Fast Principal](https://www.codereliant.io/fail-fast-pattern/). Object mapping are compared with database structure for main and child tables on first execution call to either one of this method to ensure all the columns are matching. To maintain backward compatibility, we allowed database table contains more columns than the mapped object, but not the other way round.

## Table Name
Mapping a class to database table named *Employee*.
```C#
public class Employee { ... }

[SQLName("Employee")]
public class Emp { ... }
```    

## Column Name
All public properties with public getters and setters are treated as SQL columns. By default, the property names are used as column names.
```C#
public class Employee
{
    //Database Column: Name = 'Name', Type = TEXT
    public string Name {get; set;}

    //Database Column: Name = 'Department', Type = TEXT
    [SQLName("Department")]
    public string Dept {get; set;}

    //Database Column: Name = 'Salary', Type = INTEGER
    public int Salary {get; set;}

    //Database Column: Name = 'Cost', Type = NUMERIC
    public double Cost {get; set;}

    //Read only property is not a valid SQL Column
    public int Age {get;}
}
```
**NOTE**: SQLite automatically convert values to the appropriate datatype. More details in SQLite documentation [Type Affinity](https://sqlite.org/datatype3.html#type_affinity)

## Data Type
Table below show default data type mapping object and database.

| Object Type | Database Type |
|----|----|
| string, enum, DateTime | TEXT
| int, double, long, decimal, float | INTEGER, NUMERIC |

Enum and DateTime values can be stored as integer in Database by adding `SQLDataType` attribute. Enum `Status` stored as integer while `DateTime` stored as ticks (long).
```C#
public enum Status { ... }
public class MyTable
{
    [SQLDataType(DataType.INTEGER)]
    public Status CurrentStatus {get; set;}

    [SQLDataType(DataType.INTEGER)]
    public DateTime LastUpdate {get; set;}
}
```

## Index Table
The following example illustrates that `UserName` is stored as an index in column named `NameID` of `Employee` table , while the string value is stored in a key-value pair table named `Name`. This setup allows for efficient retrieval and management of data especially when same name is used multiple time in different tables.

```C#
public class Employee
{
    [SQLIndex]
    [SQLName('NameID')]
    public string UserName {get; set;}
}
```

```
Employee (Table)
  |- NameID, INTEGER
  | ...

Name (Table)
  |- ID, INTEGER, Primary Key
  |- Name, TEXT
```

## Primary Key
The primary key attribute corresponds to the primary key in the database table.
When you execute the `WriteToDatabase` method with an item where the ID is equal to 0, a new entry will be added to the database table with the next assigned unique ID. Otherwise, a row with matching ID will be updated.
```C#
public class Employee
{
    [PrimaryKey]
    public int ID {get; set;}
    ...
}
```

## Child Table
Consider the following example, list of object `List<Employee>` is treated as child table with one to many relation. Property name `Employees` shall be used as Table name for child table unless explicitly specified by `SQLName` attribute which stated table name as `Employee` as shown below.
```C#
public class Department
{
    [PrimaryKey]
    public int ID { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    [SQLName("Employee")]
    public List<Employee> Employees { get; set; } = new List<Employee>();
    ...
}

public class Employee
{
    [PrimaryKey]
    public int ID { get; set; }
    [SQLIndexTable]
    public string Name { get; set; }
    [ParentKey(typeof(Department))]
    public int DepartmentID { get; set; }
    ...
}
```
Equivalent database table are given as follow:
```
Department (Table)
  |- ID, INTEGER, Primary Key
  |- Name, TEXT

Employee (Table)
  |- ID, INTEGER, Primary Key
  |- Name, TEXT
  |- DepartmentID, INTEGER  
```
`DepartmentID` stored the `ID` of `Department` table for respective row.

## Multiple Database Source
SQLiteHelper support multiple database source, allow data to read from tables stored in different SQLite database file. Example below showing that `Department` table is stored in main database while `Employee` table is table stored in **Employee.db**. Switching between main and sub database are handled internally by read and write method.
```C#
public class Department
{
    ...
    [SQLName("Employee")]
    [SQLDatabase("Employee.db")]
    public List<Employee> Employees { get; set; } = new List<Employee>();
}
```
